	<h1>Blood Donation Process</h1>
	<h2>Your donation</h2>
	<p>When you are comfortable on the chair, you will be asked your name, address and date of birth again.<br>
<br>
Blood bags and sample tubes are labelled with unique donor identification numbers. All collection equipment is<br>
 single use and sterile; only one blood bag is filled with your donation.<br>
<br>
A blood pressure cuff will be placed on your arm to maintain a small amount of pressure during your donation.<br>
 The cuff is not used to measure blood pressure.<br>
<br>
Your arm will be thoroughly examined to find a suitable vein before being cleaned with an antiseptic sponge.<br>
 This kills normal bacteria (germs) on the skin. You will see staff cleaning their hands frequently, using hand wipes or gels.<br>
<br>
Donors are advised to do applied muscle tension exercises during donation. This is to maintain blood pressure<br>
 and promote wellbeing during and after donation.<br>
<br>
Following needle insertion you should be comfortable during your donation. If you experience any discomfort or<br>
 pain please alert a member of staff.<br>
<br>
An agitator scale constantly weighs and measures your donation. It will stop automatically when your donation <br>
is complete. Donor carers will be available to you throughout your donation.<br>
<br>
You may hear beeping noises from the agitator, these inform us of the progress of your donation. A full donation<br>
 is 470ml and will usually take between 5 and 10 minutes.<br>
<br>
If you require assistance or have any concerns, please make us aware by raising your non-donation arm. After <br>
donation, the needle will be removed and a sterile dressing applied to your arm.<br>
<br>
We advise that you leave the pressure roll on for 30 minutes and the plaster dressing on for 6 hours. Please avoid<br>
 using this arm to push on or to carry anything heavy.<br>
<br>
We will give you a card at the end of your donation with important care advice. Donors are also asked to apply<br>
 additional pressure to the venepuncture site while waiting for their drink at the refreshment area.<br>
<br></p>
	<h2>After donation refreshment</h2>
	<p>A selection of drinks and snacks are available at the refreshment table. We encourage donors to relax here for at<br>
 least 15 minutes and to have at least 2 drinks following donation.<br>
<br>
If you feel unwell, please remain seated and alert a member of staff immediately. Where possible, we encourage<br>
 you to book an appointment for your next donation.<br><br></p>
