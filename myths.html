	<h1>Blood Donation Myths</h1>
	<p>Blood donation is something that we all want to do but never get around to it either due to fear or a number of<br>
	myths surrounding it. Here we attempt to bust some of<br>
	the most common myths associated with blood donation.</p>
	<h2>Myth 1: Donating blood will hurt.</h2>
	<p>Fact: Blood donation does involve a needle prick, but it is not a painful procedure. It only involves momentary<br> discomfort.</p>
	<h2>Myth 2: My health will deteriorate after donating blood.</h2>
	<p>Fact: This is not true. In fact, research has shown that donating blood reduces your chances of developing<br>
	cardiovascular diseases and prevents excess iron from accumulating in the body.<br>
<br>
A prior medical examination is performed to ascertain if the person is fit enough to donate blood. If your<br>
 hemoglobin level is below 12.5 gm percent or if you are unfit due to any other reasons, you will not be allowed to<br>
 donate blood.</p>
	<h2>Myth 3: I will become blood deficit after I donate blood.</h2>
	<p>Fact: Donating blood will not result in a deficit of blood. Blood volume returns to normal levels within 48 hours<br>
	after blood donation. A healthy individual with good eating habits can donate blood four times a year with a gap of<br>
	three months.</p>
	<h2>Myth 4:  My blood type is common, so I do not need to donate blood as it will<br> only serve as surplus.</h2>
	<p>Fact : There is a constant demand of all blood groups. Major surgeries, trauma etc require large amounts of<br>
	blood. If your blood group is common, it means that there would be more number of people in need of your blood<br>
	type.</p>
	<h2>Myth 5 : I will need to rest a day after I donate blood.</h2>
	<p>Fact : You can resume work or go back to your normal routine almost immediately after donating blood. However,<br>
	you need to take care of the following:<br>
<br>
Drink at least 10 -12 glasses of water and/or other liquids within 24 hours following blood donation. However, one<br>
 needs to avoid alcohol for a day or two.<br>
<br>
Avoid driving, prolonged exposure to the sun or smoking for three to four hours after blood donation.</p>
	<h2>Myth 6:  Donating blood can lead to obesity.</h2>
	<p>Fact: Donating blood does not directly affect your body weight. Some people eat more than normal and avoid<br>
	exercise after donation that may in turn lead to weight gain.</p>
	<h2>Myth 7:  I suffer from high blood pressure, I can’t donate blood.</h2>
	<p>Fact: As long the blood pressure is below 180 mm/Hg systolic and 100 mm/Hg dialstolic at the time of your<br>
	donation, you may give blood. Medications that you take for high blood pressure do not disqualify you from<br>
	donating.</p>
	<h2>Myth 8:  I suffer from diabetes and cannot donate blood.</h2>
	<p>Fact:  According to doctors, diabetics may donate blood as long as their sugar levels are within the permitted<br>
	range and the other medical requirements are met.</p>
	<h2>Myth 9:  I am too old to donate blood.</h2>
	<p>Fact: There is no longer an upper age limit for donation. As long as the prior medical examination states that you<br>
	are fit and healthy, you can donate blood.</p>
	<h2>Myth 10:  Donating blood may expose me to various infections such as HIV.</h2>
	<p>Fact: If you make sure that new needles are used and sterilization is maintained during the blood donation, there<br>
	are no chances of being exposed to HIV or other infections.</p>
