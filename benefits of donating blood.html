	<h1>Benefits of Donating Blood</h1>
	<p>There’s no substitute for blood donation and giving blood regularly saves lives. One single donation can be split<br>
	into three separate parts, helping, saving or improvising the lives of patients. Just three teaspoons of blood can<br>
	save the life of a premature baby. If you donate blood, you can help in saving lives of many people.</p>
	<h2>Improves Heart Health</h2>
	<p>Donating blood improves your overall cardio vascular health. Increased level of iron in the<br>
	blood raises the chance of heart diseases. Regularly donating blood helps males in particular to reduce the amount of iron in the<br>
	blood. This can reduce the chance of heart attack by 88%. Additionally, regular blood donation can lower the risk<br>
	of severe cardio vascular events such as stroke by 33%.</p>
	<h2>Burns calories</h2>
	<p>Donating blood on a regular basis can also improve fitness. Donating one pint of blood (450ml) burns 650 calories<br>
	in donor’s body.</p>
	<h2>Enhances feeling of well being in elderly people</h2>
	<p>Many elderly people who are in good health have reported feeling invigorated and re-energized by giving blood<br>
	on a regular basis</p>
	<h2>Reduces the risk of cancer</h2>
	<p>Give blood to help lower your risk of cancer. According to the Miller- keystone blood center, consistent blood<br>
	donation is associated with lowered risks of cancers, including liver, lung, colon, stomach and throat cancers. Risk<br>
	levels drop in correlation with how often participants donate blood.</p>
	<h2>Saves lives</h2>
	<p>By donating blood, many lives are saved and hope is given to many whose situation may otherwise be hopeless.<br>
	Blood donors give such patients a second chance of life.</p>
	<h2>Free health screening done</h2>
	<p>In addition to all of these benefits, a donor receives a free prior health screening plus mini blood test. There will<br>
	be an Hb (Haemoglobin) level test as well as a blood pressure and body check.  Blood is also tested for some<br>
	major diseases and the donor is immediately informed in strict confidentiality if any of these tests show positive<br>
	results.</p>
	<h2>Bring joy to many</h2>
	<p>When you donate blood, your help not only the patient whose life may depend on your donation, but also all those<br>
	who depend on that patient. The entire community will benefit from the spirit of generosity.</p>
	<h2>Blood donation is service to humankind</h2>
	<p>By donating blood you help the needy and save precious lives.</p>
